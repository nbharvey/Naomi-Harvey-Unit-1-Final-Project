            <p>
                I started my career in education, driven by a love for learning and
                problem-solving. Over time, I found myself increasingly drawn to the
                world of software engineering‚Äîwhere creativity, logic, and innovation
                collide. With support from my brother and a strong self-taught
                foundation, I made the leap into tech.
